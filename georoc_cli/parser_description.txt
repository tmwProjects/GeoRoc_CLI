                Here are a few additional notes:

                - For an appropriate more advanced use of this CLI programme, pleas use the -m flag
                  for the manual in this programme. (I expand an appropriate Manuel regularly.)

                - To use the CLI program an API key is necessary which must be stored in the script config.py
                  in the variable "api_key". To get the API key, please contact the DIGIS GEOROC team.

                - The Limit parameter refers to the number of SampleIDs.

                - It is necessary to use 2 - 3 sample options.

                - After executing a command, a file named "georoc_data_{Y-m-d_H-M-S}.csv" is created in the
                  local folder "Georoc_Datasets" (default) with the data you want to include. If you wish, you can
                  also specify a desired path. In addition, a duplicate of the dataset is created, which has been
                  structured, pivoted and the NaN values replaced with zeros.

                - All parameters for the sample flags must be written in capital letters.

                - All parameters for the JSON keys must be written as they were stored in the directory.
                  Here is the possibility to simply copy and paste them as desired.

                Here is an example command:

                python3 georoc_cli.py \\
                --limit "3" \\
                --location1 "EAST AFRICAN RIFT" \\
                --location2 "ETHIOPIAN RIFT" \\
                --setting "RIFT VOLCANICS" \\
                --key Item_Name \\
                --key Values \\
                --key Units \\
                --key Longitude \\
                --key Latitude

                Information about the current version:

                - The first version is designed to extract primarily geochemical numerical data through the API.
                  In the command example above, you can see from the --key flags that this works well.

                - If you only want the data for a specific publication, you can use the --doi filter parameter, which works well.

                - The program is currently designed for flat JSON structures, which means that nested structures
                  such as for the "References" or "Loc_Data" flag will not be passed to the csv file in a structured way.

                - The GEOROC database and the associated API interface are developed on a regular basis. If the program
                  does not work as usual, visit the API documentation.

                - The program and the server need about 7 seconds to retrieve the data per sample ID. If you want
                  to retrieve a lot of data, feel free to get a c[_].
